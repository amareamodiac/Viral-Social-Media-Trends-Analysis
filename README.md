# 📊 Viral Social Media Trends Analysis

This project explores patterns behind viral content on social media using a dataset containing metrics like views, likes, shares, and comments.  
The goal is to understand what makes content go viral — is it about being seen, liked, or shared?

---

## 🔍 Objectives

- Clean and preprocess real-world social media data
- Explore and visualize distribution of engagement metrics
- Identify correlations between views, likes, shares, and comments
- Extract insights that define viral content behavior

---

## 🧰 Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Dataset: Cleaned_Viral_Social_Media_Trends.csv

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- Not all viral content has the highest views — high engagement ratios (likes + shares + comments) matter more
- Strong correlation found between views and likes, but shares and comments vary
- Presence of outliers suggests sudden spikes in trend (viral moments)
- Engagement rate is a better metric than views alone
